CS-341: Project ideas

- Random terrain generation with noise
	- min: Mountain landscape generated + basic phong lighting from sun
	- bonus0: add multiple light sources (eg lamps?)
	- bonus1: ice (glacier) + water level with different specular elemtns.
	- bonus 2: different biome generation -> multiple textures
	- bonus 3: make water look like fluid (waves/like optional sun step)

- Recursive raytracing -> mirrors (maybe with screen as light source?)
	- Object (horse?) + 2/3 mirrors in an angle
	- multiple instance of scene in mirrors and multiple shadows?

- Realistic tree generation with noise/fractals + raytracing?
	- min: single tree generation + basic raytracing
	- bonus0: volumic light sources -> soft shadows
	- bonus1: add animation (eg wind?)
	- bonus2: different parameters -> seasons (no/with leaves, different color)
	- bonus3: generate forest with multiple trees

- City skyline with different light models
	- min: skyline + phong
	- bonus1: sliders for changing parameters (position sun, color, etc)
	- bonus2: clouds + water for reflections?
	- bonus3: fog that acts as a filter for light intensity (ex -20%)
	- bonus4: real time rendering -> eg sunrise/sunset + light effects

- Rain + water on ground scene?
	- refraction?
	- semi-specular (on inversed side) -> fake transparency?

- Clouds + lightening ?
	- lightening path generation with noise (as billboard?)
	- cloud 3d (noise generated) where can move the camera with keyboard
	- Some ambient light (phong model) and lightening = extra short time light

- Old map generation? artificially age it with light effects?

- Raytracing on diamond-like stone? Shiny!
	- with transparency/refraction?
	- fake it: consider one ray inside, can not go out, 0.9 attenuation and output the lightray on the normal that goes inside?

- Particle effects? (eg fire, firework, realistic watter flow, etc)
